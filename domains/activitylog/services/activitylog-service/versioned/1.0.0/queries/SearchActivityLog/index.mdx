## Overview
Search for activity log entries which match the specified search criteria.
Query may include reserved characters, which need to be URL-encoded: plus sign (+), and square brackets ([]).
Due to background indexing, new entries could take a few seconds before they appear in the search results.





## GET `(/v1.0/activitylogentries)`

### Parameters
- **offset** (query): Number of entries to skip from the beginning of the response (does not affect `totalHits`).
- **limit** (query): Maximum number of entries to include in the response (does not affect `totalHits`).

Only entries submitted in the given time frame are returned.
Format: `[DATETIME,DATETIME]`, where `DATETIME` is either `YYYY-MM-DDK`, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssK`, or `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.fffK`.
Default value is a one-week range ending at the moment of the request.
Examples: `[2019-05-23Z,2019-05-30Z]`, `[2019-05-23T14:00:00+03:00,2019-05-23T23:00:00+03:00]`.

Exact definitions of "word" and "prefix" depend on the language of the value.
