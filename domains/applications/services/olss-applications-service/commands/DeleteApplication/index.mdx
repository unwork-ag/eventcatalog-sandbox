## Overview
This method is used to delete the application specified by the **appid** parameter. Either
the **id** or **uniqueKey** properties may be used for this parameter.

Drivers and permissions will be removed with their associated application.

It is an error to try and delete an Application currently associated with an Instrument or
InstrumentController. The Instrument or InstrumentController must first be deleted before
deleting the Application.

The caller must have been granted Security_Manage permission in order to delete an application.

A call made with a non-user token will return status code 403.
